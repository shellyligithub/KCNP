## General info
National park lodging is so popular such that we need to query so often to check the availability in order to make an reservation. This project automates the querying process. As long as you code in the arrival date, departure date, number of adults, number of kids and the interested lodges, the program will access the web server, fill in the itinerary information and submit the search just like you do it yourself. The search result will appear shortly.
